Lua script to allow installing and viewing package groups, determined by 
a backend script to allow it to work on arbitrary group-metadata formats.

This script must be plugged into the following APT script slots:

    Scripts::AptGet::Command::
    Scripts::AptCache::Command::
    Scripts::AptGet::Help::Command::
    Scripts::AptCache::Help::Command::

Additionally the backend script name must be specified with the configuration 
item Scripts::Groupinstall::Backend, the path is relative to the generic
scripts directory specified by Dir::Bin::scripts.

Usage:
    apt-cache showgroups - show all known groups
    apt-cache showgroup <group> - show description and contents of group
    apt-get groupinstall <group> - install all packages belonging to a group
    apt-get groupremove <group> - remove all packages belonging to a group

Known to work in RHL 8.0, 9 and Fedora Core 1. Requires python, comps and
rhpl packages to be installed.

Note that groupinstall can be made to work on any system where package group
data is available in some parseable format. You'll just need to write your
own backend for it, providing the following three operations

List all available groups:
<backend> showgroups
Show contents of given groups in a human-friendly format:
<backend> showgroup <group1> [<group2> ...]
List packages belonging to given groups, one package at a time (this is not
a user visible operation but is used internally by the script to determine
what packages to install/remove in groupinstall and groupremove operations)
<backend> grouppkgs <group1> [<group2> ...]
